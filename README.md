# Algorithms and Machine Learning (MATH20017) Coursework

[cite_start]This repository contains the implementation and analysis for **Assessed Coursework 1 (Part 1)** of the MATH20017 module at the University of Bristol (Autumn 2024). [cite_start]The coursework focuses on core algorithmic concepts, including divide-and-conquer proofs, Monte Carlo simulations, and selection algorithms.

## Coursework Overview
The project is divided into three major theoretical and practical questions:

### 1. Divide-and-Conquer Analysis
- [cite_start]**Master Method Proofs**: Detailed proofs demonstrating that the key lemma for the Master Method implies the Master Method Bound theorem.
- [cite_start]**Lemma Derivation**: Step-by-step derivation of the key lemma following the lecture strategy to provide a clear explanation of recurrence relation bounds.

### 2. Monte Carlo Method
- [cite_start]Analysis and implementation of probabilistic simulations using the Monte Carlo approach to estimate values or solve computational problems[cite: 3].

### 3. Selection Algorithms
- [cite_start]**Deterministic Selection**: Implementation of the `deterministic_select` algorithm.
- [cite_start]**Median of Medians**: Uses a "median of medians" strategy to find a "good" pivot, ensuring a worst-case time complexity of $\Theta(n)$.
- [cite_start]**Testing**: Includes a robust test suite (`selection_function_test`) to verify the function against Python’s native sorting sub-routines over multiple random trials.



## Implementation Details
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- [cite_start]**Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab [cite: 5]
- **Key Libraries**:
    - [cite_start]`NumPy`: Used for array manipulation and random number generation[cite: 3, 4].
    - `Matplotlib`: (If applicable) used for visualizing algorithm performance or simulation results.

## Requirements for Submission
[cite_start]According to the module requirements, the final submission must include:
1. A **PDF file** with all mathematical proofs and code outputs clearly visible.
2. The original **Jupyter Notebook** (`.ipynb`) or RMarkdown file.
3. Any supplementary files (e.g., images of handwritten proofs).
